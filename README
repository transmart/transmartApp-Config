External configuration files for transmart application
Config.groovy - transmart application configuration file
DataSource.groovy - jdbc and connection pool configuration
RmodulesConfig.groovy - configuration file for the R plugin module

these files should be put under this folder:
${transmartUser HOME Dir}/.grails/transmartConfig
for example, if 'appuser' is the user for transmart, the folder should be
~appuser/.grails/transmartAppConfig

NOTE: the name of the configuration directory is determined by the name
of the application, and the name of the application is set in the file
application.properties in the top level directory of transmartApp.
By default, the application name is transmart, so the configuration
directory is transmartConfig.
